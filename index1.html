    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(10, 9, 10);">The 1990s was the third decade in the 
        industry's history. It was a decade of marked innovation 
        in video gaming. It was a decade of transition from sprite-based graphics to full-fledged 
        3D graphics and it gave rise to several genres of video games including, but not limited to, 
        the first person shooter, real-time strategy, survival horror, and MMO. Handheld gaming began 
        to become more popular throughout the decade, thanks in part to the release of 
        the Game Boy. Arcade games, although still relatively popular in the early 1990s,
        began to decline as home consoles became more common.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px" >The 90s were a great time for video games, especially in sales. 
        Online gaming, which in previous generations had been the exclusive domain of PC games, 
        became prominent in video game consoles starting in the late 1990s. The Dreamcast initiated 
        this change in 1999 with its built in modem, internet browsing software, and ability to play 
        certain games online. Nearly all consoles since released then have had support for online gaming.
        Online gaming dominates the world today, but it's amazing to look back and see how far technology has advanced.
